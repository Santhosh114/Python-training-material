These are the python training materials that I prepared to train employess during my career in Mobius Knowledge Services. 

Due to few restrictions, I could only share the PPT files, not the assignment and examination files that were prepared for this training.

I take this opportunity to thank professor Eric Grimson from MIT, from whom I learnt the basics of python through edx.org.
